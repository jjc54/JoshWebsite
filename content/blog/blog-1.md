Phase 0 (laboratory) studies encompass the pre-clinical studies that have been performed to investigate a treatment or condition. This includes laboratory work, animal studies, and even computer modeling studies. This does not include research done on humans but can include all the same controls as human research. For one example using animal studies, I have done research testing the effects of exercise on different metabolic markers. We used a placebo concurrent control, where one group of mice were subject to treadmill running while the other group were place on a non-moving treadmill as a control. The pre-clinical data is primarily used as background and supporting evidence for further clinical research.

Phase I studies are the first to include humans and aim to determine the maximum tolerable dosage (MTD). This is accomplished by titrating up the treatment dosage until 33% of participants exhibit adverse events. During phase I, dose-comparison concurrent control seems to be most widely used to test different doses of treatment within different branches of the study until the MTD is identified.

Phase II studies aim to determine the efficacy, or ability to produce a desired result, of a certain treatment. Phase II trials can be randomized-controlled, so a wide range of controls may be used. One example is a placebo concurrent control, which will provide evidence that a treatment is working compared to a non-treatment placebo.

Phase III studies are only initiated after a treatment has been determined to be effective against a disease, but further studies are needed to determine if the new treatment is effective compared to the standard of care treatment. This can include measuring not only efficacy, but also a comparison of drug side-effects. A control that is often use is active-treatment concurrent control, allowing the investigator to determine the effectiveness of a new treatment compared to something that is already known as an effective therapy.

Phase IV studies occur post-market, and are often long-term, real-world studies. These take place within normal clinical practice as physicians prescribe new treatments to patients. Since these studies are real-word studies, controls are typically not used. However, data from previously completed trials can be evaluated and compared to the long-term data collected from phase IV studies to help determine if a drug should stay or be pulled from the market.
