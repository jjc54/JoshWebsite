title: Making Publication Metric Tracking Easy - Using a Reproducible, Integrated System of R and Microsoft Power BI® to Ease the Pain of Assessing Publication Metrics

#### Project Details

Publication metrics are increasingly being used to measure individual- and organization-level productivity and impact within academia and industry. Additionally, these metrics, including publication counts over time, are being used to make business decision. Historically, publication metrics have not been the easiest thing to quantify and manage. This is primarily due to the manual nature of querying PubMed from the web, which is difficult to do for multiple highly published authors with non-unique names. Instead of manually obtaining this data, it is much more feasible to leverage the R programming language and various reporting systems to manage this data. Importantly, many of these tools are free! This text demonstrates how R, a few R packages, and reporting systems such as Quarto® and Microsoft Power BI® can be integrated into a reproducible system capable of streamlining the collection, wrangling, and reporting process of publication data for stakeholders.
