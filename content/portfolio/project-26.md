title: Phage Based Biomarkers in Alzheimer’s Disease
---

#### Project Details

This project aimed to develop a selective and specific tau-based screening profile to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. Identifying a phage-based biomarker is the first step to creating a low-cost solution to monitoring the progression of the disease from a much earlier age.
