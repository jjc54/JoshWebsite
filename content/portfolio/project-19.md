title: Organizing and Evaluating Drug Recalls by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
---

#### Project Details

There are over 100,000 clinical trials registered in the United States that are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1 Drugs that are approved from these studies are able to enter the market, but may also be recalled and removed from the shelves at any time. Over 1,000 drugs were recalled by the FDA just last year. 2 The main goal of this project was to analyze the reasons for the 9, 185 FDA drug recalls within the last eight years, from 2011-2018.
