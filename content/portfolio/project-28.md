title: Modeling in Regression STA6235 Group Project

#### Project Details

As a group we decided to look at the Alzheimer’s Disease data set. We subset the data down to the west coast states of Arizona, California, Oregon, and Washington. For part A of the project each of us are doing a simple linear regression model with a response variable of Alzheimer’s mortality rate and have each of us using a different variable for each model. For Part B we will do the same analysis just for an individual state for each of us. Part C we will be choosing a different response variable and using the same variable we had used in the previous models to see if there is a significant linear relationship. Part D we will each be choosing a response variable and doing a multiple regression analysis and trying to compare our model choice to a stepwise regression model.

This project was completed under the direction of Dr. Raid Amin, with data and inspiration from his research project (https://link.springer.com/article/10.14283/jpad.2018.36).
