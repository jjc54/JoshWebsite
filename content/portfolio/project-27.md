#### Project Details

For our project, our group chose to look at data from Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico, Maine and Utah. We were interested in comparing the western states to Maine to see if the location and our selected variable played a role in the Alzheimer’s death rate. I chose to focus on air pollution levels in these different states to see how it affected the Alzheimer's death rate and how air pollution levels were related to other variables in the data set.

This project was completed under the direction of Dr. Raid Amin, with data and inspiration from his research project (https://link.springer.com/article/10.14283/jpad.2018.36).
