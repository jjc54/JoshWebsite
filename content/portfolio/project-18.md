title: Exercise-based regulation of blood sugar and its implications in neurological diseases and Alzheimer’s Disease
---

#### Project Details

Our research addresses how exercise can help regulate blood sugar levels despite individuals not seeing a difference in their body weight over time. This is important because the regulation of blood sugar is a key component in diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Our findings will be important to physicians and pharmaceutical industries hoping to prevent or delay the onset of diseases such as AD by controlling the metabolic processes that precede it. Our research is important to the general public because dysregulation of blood sugar is a key factor in diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease, which affects over five million people in the United States and is expected to nearly triple by 2050.
