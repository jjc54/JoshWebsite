title: Clinical Trials - A Guide to Understanding Them
---

#### Project Details

Clinical Trials are a form of research plan used to test experimental medical interventions on willing participants. They help us investigate new drugs and find new ways of treating illness. Currently, there are over 100,000 clinical trials registered in the United States with 293,000 registered worldwide. These trials are managed by clinical trial sites, many of which provide students with a unique opportunity to gain exposure to research and learn more about the pharmaceutical industry. This will be an open forum meant to facilitate open discussion and inquiry on Clinical Trials and how they apply to students, patients, and society. Attendees will be able to ask questions freely and receive answers on clinical trial related information from two Clinical Research Coordinators.
