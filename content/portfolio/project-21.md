title: Consenting Dementia Patients in Clinical Trials at UWF

#### Project Details

Informed consent is a vital part of the field of healthcare. It is the communication between healthcare provider and/or researcher and Subject/Patient that leads to permission or consent for treatment, services, or clinical trial participation. The informed consent process must clearly state what exactly the subject- and often his/her caregiver - are agreeing to do in the study. Challenges exist with cognitively impaired research Subjects, such as those with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When a Subject is unable to provide Consent due to capacity issues, the Subject's Power of Attorney (POA) / Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) should do so instead.
