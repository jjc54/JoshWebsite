#### Project Details

Dashboards are often utilized by businesses, schools, and hospitals as a key tool to organize, analyze, and visualize data that is subject to frequent updates and changes. In this way, effective dashboards enable leaders to make data-informed decisions regarding their organizations. However, there are many approaches to “cooking up” effective dashboards that utilize both proprietary and open-source software, including the SAS® and R programming languages. Using base-SAS® code as your primary ingredient, one might build an effective dashboard using a colorful combination of the Output Delivery System (ODS), PROC PRINT, PROC SGPLOT, and PROC SGPIE. In someone else’s kitchen, they might include R packages as the main ingredients for their dashboard, such as quarto, readxl, tidyverse, and gt. 

As Julia Child once said, “You don’t have to cook fancy or complicated masterpieces – just good food from fresh ingredients.” With the same notion, this paper offers a direct comparison of two dashboards prepared from two fresh, but very different ingredients: SAS® and R. This paper was written with the intent to duplicate the dishes as much as possible given the flavor (strengths) and aromas (weaknesses) of each ingredient, with emphasis being placed on comparing the setup, steps, and code of each.
