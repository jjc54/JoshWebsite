title: Statistical Considerations in the Development of a Consensus Statement
---


#### Project Details

Consensus statements serve as a key method to synthesize expert opinions, particularly in areas with limited empirical evidence or when traditional research is deemed not feasible (ex: in high-risk indications). The intricacies involved in designing and analyzing consensus statement studies require distinct statistical considerations to ensure the validity and reliability of outcomes. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the statistical considerations involved in developing a consensus statement. A focus was placed on the statistical thresholds for defining a 'consensus,' exploring the balance between agreement percentage and rounds conducted and determining the appropriate and acceptable power for consensus statement studies. The importance of feedback and the challenge of participant attrition across multiple rounds (as utilized in the Delphi method) were also considered. This study emphasizes the iterative nature of consensus statement building and the necessity for clear statistical considerations in both the design and interpretation phases to ensure the validity of the consensus statement.
