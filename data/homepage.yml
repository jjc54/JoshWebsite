    <p class="lead">
    <strong> I am a driven professional </strong>with a solid foundation in bench-to-bedside research, 
    harboring a keen interest in evolving into a physician-scientist. My journey is 
    marked by a commitment to teaching, mentorship, research, and data science. 
    Through my academic and professional endeavors, I have achieved notable 
    milestones such as the acceptance of my undergraduate honors thesis, the
    publication of undergraduate research, the successful completion of several 
    clinical trials with accompanying publications, and obtaining certifications 
    as a Project Manager (ACRP-PM) and Clinical Research Coordinator (CCRC) from 
    the Association of Clinical Research Professionals.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong> Currently, </strong>I serve as an Adjunct Professor in higher education 
    while pursuing an additional masters degree. This step is part of my 
    strategic preparation for applying to dual doctoral (M.D./Ph.D.) programs.
    My goal is to blend my expertise in biomedical sciences, clinical research, 
    and data science to emerge as a physician-scientist who can integrate 
    clinical care with research, thereby enhancing evidence-based care for 
    my patients. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong> As a science communicator and professor, </strong>I excel in both oral 
    and written communication, frequently teaching, explaining, and presenting 
    complex information and industry jargon to diverse audiences, including 
    those without a scientific background. Recognizing the significance of 
    teaching and mentorship, I am dedicated to honoring the legacy of my 
    mentors by guiding others with utmost dedication and expertise.
