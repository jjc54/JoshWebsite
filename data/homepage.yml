    <strong> As a science communicator and professor, </strong>I excel in both oral 
    and written communication, frequently teaching, explaining, and presenting 
    complex information and industry jargon to diverse audiences, including 
    those without a scientific background. Recognizing the significance of 
    teaching and mentorship, I am dedicated to honoring the legacy of my 
    mentors by guiding others with utmost dedication and expertise.
