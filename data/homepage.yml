    <p class="lead">
    <strong> Driven professional </strong> with a strong background in bench to bedside 
    research with a proven interest in pursuing a career as a physician-scientist 
    (eventually), while actively engaged in teaching, mentorship, research, 
    and data science opportunities. My academic and professional research efforts 
    have led to undergraduate honors thesis acceptance, subsequent undergraduate 
    research publication, several successfully completed clinical trials with 
    associated publications, and certification by the Association of Clinical 
    Research Professionals (ACRP) as a Project Manager (ACRP-PM) and Clinical 
    Research Coordinator (CCRC). 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong> Currently </strong> working in higher education as an Adjunct Professor while pursuing 
    an additional master’s degree to further my research-driven education in 
    preparation for dual doctoral (M.D./Ph.D.) application. I aim to synthesize 
    my knowledge of the biomedical sciences, clinical research, and data science 
    to become a physician-scientist capable of seamlessly integrating clinical 
    care with clinical research in a way that maximizes evidence-based care options 
    for my patients. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong> Proficient and effective science communicator and professor </strong>
    (both oral and written), frequently teaching, explaining, and
    presenting complex information and industry jargon to audiences of 
    various backgrounds (scientific and nonscientific). I deeply acknowledge 
    the importance of teaching and of mentorship and thus aim to honor my own 
    mentors by continuing to guide others to the best of my ability.
